### Why 100-days-of-code? 
6
​
7
This challenge will help you inculcate the habit of coding everyday apart from coding you do academically or professionally. If you perform well in the 100-days we will send you Dev-stickers to your place (if within India). We would be happy if any generous people come along to sponsor Dev-goodies for better incentives for people to join. All sponsors will be publicised on our social media platforms

We expect you to complete this journey on a day to day basis but we provide you a day of buffer of Saturday and you will be given tasks from Monday to Friday.

### What are we learning? 
18
​
19
We are learning from scratch HTML/CSS and we will be focussing lot on Javascript which we will be doing from basics to advanced. As React uses JS we don't want no loopholes in javascript basics. We will then be moving to creating basic animations in javascript which are commonly used in Webpages. We want you to learn how to create these from scratch and not use any templates or a existing library. After that we will be moving forward to MERN stack.
